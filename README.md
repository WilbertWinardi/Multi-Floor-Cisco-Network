# Multi-Floor Cisco Network

A comprehensive multi-floor network infrastructure project designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates network design principles, routing, switching, and inter-floor connectivity in a simulated enterprise environment.

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a Computer Network project (AOL - Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming Lab) that simulates a multi-floor building network infrastructure using Cisco networking equipment and protocols.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **Cisco AOL ComNet.pkt** - The main Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file containing the complete multi-floor network topology, device configurations, and network design.

- **PPT - AOL Computer Network.pdf** - A comprehensive presentation (20 pages) documenting the project design, implementation details, network architecture, and technical specifications.

- **Link Video Presentasi.txt** - Contains the link to the video presentation demonstrating the network implementation and explaining the project in detail.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and interact with this project, you will need:

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Version 7.0 or higher recommended)
  - Download from: [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
  - Free registration required

### How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WilbertWinardi/Multi-Floor-Cisco-Network.git
   cd Multi-Floor-Cisco-Network
   ```

2. **Open the Packet Tracer file:**
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer
   - Go to File → Open
   - Navigate to the repository folder
   - Open `Cisco AOL ComNet.pkt`

3. **Explore the network:**
   - View the network topology across multiple floors
   - Inspect device configurations (routers, switches, PCs)
   - Test connectivity using ping, traceroute, and other network tools
   - Observe packet flow in simulation mode

4. **Review the documentation:**
   - Open `PPT - AOL Computer Network.pdf` to understand the design decisions and implementation details
   - Watch the video presentation linked in `Link Video Presentasi.txt` for a complete walkthrough

## 🎥 Video Presentation

A detailed video presentation explaining the project implementation is available. The link can be found in the `Link Video Presentasi.txt` file.
